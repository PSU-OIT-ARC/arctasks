# ARC Tasks

This package implements common tasks for ARC Django projects. Tasks are
implemented using [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/).

The tasks in this package have been extracted from various other ARC projects,
cleaned up, generalized, and made more configurable. The lineage is `rethink`
=> `ohslib` => `gp21` => `arctasks`.
